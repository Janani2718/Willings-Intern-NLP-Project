# Willings-Intern-NLP-Project

I have done this NLP based resume parser project during Internship at Willing, Inc.

## Business Understanding
Willings being a human resources consulting company, its work predominantly involves screening candidate resumes and thus matching with the most similar company. The process of screening numerous resumes manually is tedious and painstaking. The aim of this project is to automate this process. By bringing together the power of NLP and other ML Techniques, I strived to accomplish extracting useful entities from any given resume.
